Feedly Checker
======

Feedly Checker is an extension for Google Chrome that displays a count of unread articles on Feedly. Feedly Checker will automatically detect the Feedly account you are signed into and update its count each minute. Much more functionality will soon be added, especially including the ability to read articles directly from the extension's popup page.
